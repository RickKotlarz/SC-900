## Describe the Concepts of Security, Compliance, and Identity (10-15%)

### Describe security and compliance concepts & methodologies

| Methodologies| Description |
|---|---|
| [Zero-Trust methodology](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/) | Zero Trust model assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network. Regardless of where the request originates or what resource it accesses, the Zero Trust model teaches us to "never trust, always verify." The Zero Trust model has three principles which guide and underpin how security is implemented. These are: verify explicitly, least privilege access, and assume breach. <br/> **1 - Verify explicitly**. Always authenticate and authorize based on the available data points, including user identity, location, device, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies. <br/> **2 - Least privileged access**. Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection to protect both data and productivity. <br/> **3 - Assume breach**. Segment access by network, user, devices, and application. Use encryption to protect data, and use analytics to get visibility, detect threats, and improve your security.<br/> <br/> **Six foundational pillars of Zero Trust** <br/> <br/>  In the Zero Trust model, all elements work together to provide end-to-end security. These six elements are the foundational pillars of the Zero Trust model: <br/>    **1 - Identities**  may be users, services, or devices. When an identity attempts to access a resource, it must be verified with strong authentication, and follow least privilege access principles. <br/>  **2 - Devices**  create a large attack surface as data flows from devices to on-premises workloads and the cloud. Monitoring devices for health and compliance is an important aspect of security. <br/>   **3 - Applications**  are the way that data is consumed. This includes discovering all applications being used, sometimes called Shadow IT because not all applications are managed centrally. This pillar also includes managing permissions and access. <br/>   **4 - Data**  should be classified, labeled, and encrypted based on its attributes. Security efforts are ultimately about protecting data, and ensuring it remains safe when it leaves devices, applications, infrastructure, and networks that the organization controls. <br/>  **5 - Infrastructure**, whether on-premises or cloud based, represents a threat vector. To improve security, you assess for version, configuration, and JIT access, and use telemetry to detect attacks and anomalies. This allows you to automatically block or flag risky behavior and take protective actions. <br/>   **6 - Networks**  should be segmented, including deeper in-network micro segmentation. Also, real-time threat protection, end-to-end encryption, monitoring, and analytics should be employed.<br/>![The Zero Trust model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/wwl-sci/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/media/2-zero-trust-pillars-v2.png)|
| [Shared responsibility model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/3-describe-shared-responsibility-model)  | [Reference AZ-900](https://github.com/RickKotlarz/az-900/blob/master/az900.md#shared-responsibility-model-in-the-cloud) |
| [Defense in Depth](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/4-describe-defense-depth) |Defense in depth is a strategy that employs a series of mechanisms to slow the advance of an attack that's aimed at acquiring unauthorized access to information. Each layer provides protection so that if one layer is breached, a subsequent layer is already in place to prevent further exposure. |
| [Common threats](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/5-describe-common-threats) |Common threats include:<br/> &bull; **Data breach** -  A data breach is when data is stolen, and this includes personal data.<br/> &bull; **Dictionary attack** - A dictionary attack is a type of identity attack where a hacker attempts to steal an identity by trying a large number of known passwords. Each password is automatically tested against a known username. Dictionary attacks are also known as brute force attacks. <br/> &bull; **Ransomware** - Malware is the term used to describe malicious applications and code that can cause damage and disrupt normal use of devices. Malware can give attackers unauthorized access, which allows them to use system resources, lock you out of your computer, and ask for ransom. <br/> &bull; **Disruptive attacks** - A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack attempts to exhaust an application's resources, making the application unavailable to legitimate users. DDoS attacks can be targeted at any endpoint that is publicly reachable through the internet. Other common threats include coin miners, rootkits, trojans, worms, and exploits and exploit kits.|
| [Encryption / hashing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/6-describe-ways-encryption-hashing-secure-data) | There are two top-level types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric. **Symmetric encryption** uses the ***same key*** to encrypt and decrypt the data.<br/> **Asymmetric encryption** uses a ***public key and private key pair***. Either key can encrypt data, but a single key canâ€™t be used to decrypt encrypted data. To decrypt, you need a paired key. Asymmetric encryption is used for things like Transport Layer Security (TLS), such as the HTTPS protocol, and data signing. Encryption may protect data at rest, or in transit. <br/>![The concept of symmetric and asymmetric encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/wwl-sci/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/media/6-encryption.png)<br/> <br/> **Encryption at rest** also known as, data at rest, is the data that's stored on a physical device, such as a server. It may be stored in a database or a storage account but, regardless of where it's stored, encryption of data at rest ensures the data is unreadable without the keys and secrets needed to decrypt it. If an attacker obtained a hard drive with encrypted data and didn't have access to the encryption keys, they would be unable to read the data. <br/><br/> **Encryption in transit** - Data in transit is the data moving from one location to another, such as across the internet or through a private network. Secure transfer can be handled by several different layers. It could be done by encrypting the data at the application layer before sending it over a network. HTTPS is an example of encryption in transit. Encrypting data in transit protects it from outside observers and provides a mechanism to transmit data while limiting the risk of exposure. <br/> <br/> **Hashing** - uses an algorithm to convert the original text to a unique fixed-length hash value. Each time the same text is hashed using the same algorithm, the same hash value is produced. That hash can then be used as a unique identifier of its associated data. Hashing is different to encryption in that it doesn't use keys, and the hashed value isn't subsequently decrypted back to the original. Hashing is used to store passwords. When a user enters their password, the same algorithm that created the stored hash creates a hash of the entered password. This is compared to the stored hashed version of the password. If they match, the user has entered their password correctly. This is more secure than storing plain text passwords, but hashing algorithms are also known to hackers. ![The concept of hashing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/wwl-sci/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/media/6-hashing-3-inline.png)|
| [Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/4-describe-defense-depth)| **Confidentiality** refers to the need to keep confidential sensitive data such as customer information, passwords, or financial data. <br/> **Integrity** refers to keeping data or messages correct.<br/> **Availability** refers to making data available to those who need it. |
| [Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-resource-governance-capabilities-azure/) | The **Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)** for Azure is guidance that provides a proven and consistent methodology for implementing cloud technologies that are designed to help you create and implement business and technology strategies for the cloud based on best practices, documentation, and tools.  <br/> **CAF lifecycle includes the following:** <br/>  **1.	Strategy** - Define business justification and expected outcomes of adoption. <br/> **2.	Plan** - Align actionable adoption plans to business outcomes.   <br/>  **3.	Ready** - Prepare the cloud environment for the planned changes and move resources in. <br/>  **4.	Adopt:** <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;  ***Migrate:*** Migrate and modernize existing workloads. <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; ***Innovate***: Develop new cloud-native or hybrid solutions.  <br/> **5.	Govern** - Establish a well-managed cloud environment <br/> **6. Manage** - Operations management for cloud and hybrid solutions. <br/> <br/> [What is the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/overview)|

### Define identity concepts

| Identity concepts | Description
|--|--|
|[Identity as the primary security perimeter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-identity-principles-concepts/3-define-identity-primary-security-perimeter) | The traditional perimeter-based security model is no longer enough. Identity has become the new security perimeter that enables organizations to secure their assets. An identity is how someone or something can be verified and authenticated to be who they say they are. An identity may be associated with a user, an application, a device, or something else. Addressing each of these four pillars is key to a comprehensive and robust identity and access control solution. <br/> <br/> **Four pillars of identity** <br/> Identity is a concept that spans an entire environment, so organizations need to think about it broadly. There's a collection of processes, technologies, and policies for managing digital identities and controlling how they're used to access resources. <br/> <br/> There are four fundamental pillars of identity that organizations should consider when creating an identity infrastructure. <br/> <br/> **1 - Administration** - Administration is about the creation and management/governance of identities for users, devices, and services. As an administrator, you manage how and under what circumstances the characteristics of identities can change (be created, updated, deleted).<br/> **2 - Authentication** - The authentication pillar tells the story of how much assurance for a particular identity is enough. In other words, how much does an IT system need to know about an identity to have sufficient proof that they really are who they say they are? It involves the act of challenging a party for legitimate credentials. Authentication is sometimes shortened to AuthN. <br/> **3 - Authorization** - The authorization pillar is about processing the incoming identity data to determine the level of access an authenticated person or service has within the application or service that it wants to access. Authorization is sometimes shortened to AuthZ. <br/>**4 - Auditing** - The auditing pillar is about tracking who does what, when, where, and how. Auditing includes having in-depth reporting, alerts, and governance of identities. |
| [Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-vs-authorization) (Who are you?) | The process of establishing the identity of a person or service looking to access a resource. It involves the act of challenging a party for legitimate credentials, and provides the basis for creating a security principal for identity and access control use. It establishes if they are who they say they are. |
| [Authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-vs-authorization) (What are you allowed to do?) | The process of establishing what level of access an authenticated person or service has. It specifies what data they're allowed to access and what they can do with it. |
| [Identity providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/identity-providers) | An identity provider creates, maintains, and manages identity information while providing authentication services to applications. When sharing your apps and resources with external users, Azure AD is the default identity provider for sharing. This means when you invite external users who already have an Azure AD or Microsoft account, they can automatically sign in without further configuration on your part. <br/><br/> &bull; Azure [B2B collaboration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/enable-external-collaboration-with-b2b/) collaboration lets you securely share your company's applications and services with guest users from any other organization, while maintaining control over your own corporate data. <br/> &bull; [B2C  access management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/enable-external-access-with-b2c/) an idenity management solution for consumer facing apps. The Azure AD B2C service allows you to  manage customer identities and their access to your applications. <br/> [Identity Providers for External Identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/identity-providers)|
| [Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc758436(v=ws.10)) | A directory is a hierarchical structure that stores information about objects on the network. A directory service, such as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators. For example, AD DS stores information about user accounts, such as names, passwords, phone numbers, and so on, and enables other authorized users on the same network to access this information. <br/> <br/> [Overview of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/active-directory-domain-services-overview) |
| [Concept of Federated Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-fed) | Federation enables the access of services across organizational or domain boundaries by establishing trust relationships between the respective domainâ€™s identity provider. With federation, there's no need for a user to maintain a different username and password when accessing resources in other domains. <br/><br/> Federation is a collection of domains that have established trust. The level of trust may vary, but typically includes authentication and almost always includes authorization.  <br/> <br/> You can federate your on-premises environment with Azure AD and use this federation for authentication and authorization. This sign-in method ensures that all user authentication occurs on-premises. This method allows administrators to implement more rigorous levels of access control. Federation with [AD FS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/ad-fs-overview) and PingFederate is available. |
| [Identity Attacks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-identity-principles-concepts/2-describe-common-identity-attacks?WT.mc_id=esi_studyguide_content_wwl) | **Password-based attacks** - Many password-based attacks employ brute force techniques to gain unauthorized access. In a brute force attack, an attacker will attempt to gain access simply by trying different usernames and password combinations. <br/> <br/> **Phishing** - A phishing attack is when a hacker sends an email that appears to come from a reputable source. The email contains a credible story, such as a security breach, instructing the user to sign in and change their password. Instead of going to a legitimate website, the user is directed to the scammerâ€™s website where they enter their username and password. The hacker has now captured the userâ€™s identity, and their password. <br/> <br/> **Spear phishing** - A spear phishing scam is a variant on phishing. Hackers build databases of information about users, which can be used to create highly credible emails. The email may appear to come from someone in your organization who is requesting information. Although careful scrutiny might uncover the fraud, users may not read it carefully enough and send the requested information or login to the website before they realize the fraud. This practice is called spear phishing because it's highly targeted.|

### Describe the basic identity services and identity types of Azure AD

|Capabilities Term | Description|
|--|--|
|[Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-basic-services-identity-types/2-describe-what-azure-active-directory)| Reference AZ-900|
|[Azure AD identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-basic-services-identity-types/4-describe-identity-types) | **User** - A user identity is a representation of something that's managed by Azure AD. Employees and guests are represented as users in Azure AD. If you have several users with the same access needs, you can create a group. You use groups to give access permissions to all members of the group, instead of having to assign access rights individually.  <br/> **Service principal** - A service principal is a security identity used by applications or services to access specific Azure resources. You can think of it as an identity for an application that is commonly reffered to by its Service Principal Name (SPN). <br/> **Managed identity** -Managed identities are typically used to manage the credentials for authenticating a cloud application with an Azure service. Managed identities are automatically managed in Azure AD and may be user assigned or system assigned. <br/>  *There are several benefits to using managed identities, including:* <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Application developers can authenticate to services that support managed identities for Azure resources. For a complete list of services, refer to Azure Services that support managed identities. <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Any Azure service that supports Azure AD authentication can use managed identities to authenticate to another Azure service; for example, accessing Azure Key Vault. Managed identities can be used without any extra cost. <br/>  **Device** - A device is a piece of hardware, such as mobile devices, laptops, servers, or printer. Device identities can be set up in different ways in Azure AD, to determine properties such as who owns the device.|
| [Hybrid identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/implement-manage-hybrid-identity/) | Hybrid identity referes to an identity solution that allows users both on-premises and in the cloud to authenticate using a single common user identity. <br/><br/> **Three hybrid authentication models exist within Azure:**<br/> **[Password hash synchronization (PHS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/implement-manage-hybrid-identity/3-password-hash-synchronization)** - Password hash synchronization is one of the sign-in methods used to accomplish hybrid identity. Azure AD Connect synchronizes a hash, of the hash, of a user's password from an on-premises Active Directory instance to a cloud-based Azure AD instance. <br/> **[Pass-through authentication (PTA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/implement-manage-hybrid-identity/4-pass-through-authentication)** - Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) pass-through authentication allows your users to sign in to both on-premises and cloud-based applications by using the same passwords. Pass-through authentication signs users in by validating their passwords directly against on-premises Active Directory. <br/> **[Federated authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/implement-manage-hybrid-identity/6-federation)** - Federation is a collection of domains that have established trust. The level of trust may vary, but typically includes authentication and almost always includes authorization. <br/><br/> ***Azure AD Connect provides a simplified method to enable these hybrid solutions and allow users to log into Azure AD resources using their on-premises password.*** |
| [Different external identity types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/) (Guest Users) | With External Identities in Azure AD, you can allow people outside your organization to access your apps and resources, while letting them sign in using whatever identity they prefer. Within this framework, Azure AD supports a variety of scenarios from business-to-business (B2B) collaboration to access management for consumer/customer- or citizen-facing applications (business-to-customer, or B2C). ***Azure AD External Identities focuses less on a user's relationship to your organization and more on how the user wants to sign in to your apps and resources.*** <br/> [John Saville YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P10hgPDRZg)|
[What is a device identity?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/overview) | A device identity is an object in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This device object is similar to users, groups, or applications. A device identity gives administrators information they can use when making access or configuration decisions. <br/> <br/>There are three ways to get a device identity: <br/> &bull; Azure AD registration  <br/> &bull; Azure AD join  <br/> &bull; Hybrid Azure AD join <br/>  <br/>Device identities are a prerequisite for scenarios like device-based Conditional Access policies and Mobile Device Management with Microsoft Endpoint Manager.|

### Describe the authentication capabilities of Azure AD

| Term | Description |
|--|--|
| [Different authentication methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-methods) | ![Auth-Methods.png](https://github.com/RickKotlarz/SC-900/blob/main/Auth-Methods.png?raw=true) |
| [What authentication and verification methods are available in Azure Active Directory?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-methods)  | Verification methods include: <br/>   &bull; Mobile app notification <br/> &bull; Mobile app code <br/> &bull; Email <br/> &bull; Mobile phone (SMS) <br/> &bull; Office phone (voice) <br/> &bull; Security questions <br/> &bull; Physical token (e.g. FIDO2 key)|
| [Self-service password reset (SSPR)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-authentication-capabilities/5-describe-self-service-password-reset) | Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) self-service password reset (SSPR) gives users the ability to change or reset their password, with no administrator or help desk involvement. <br/> <br/> Self-service password reset works in the following scenarios: <br/> &bull; Password change: when a user knows their password but wants to change it to something new. <br/>  &bull; Password reset: when a user can't sign in, such as when they forget the password, and want to reset it. <br/>  &bull; Account unlock: when a user can't sign in because their account is locked out. [Self-service password reset (SSPR)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-sspr) |
| [Password protection and management capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-authentication-capabilities/6-describe-password-protection-management) |  &bull; **Global banned password list** - A global banned password list with known weak passwords is automatically updated and enforced by Microsoft. This list is maintained by the Azure AD Identity Protection team, who analyze security telemetry data to find weak or compromised passwords. Examples of passwords that might be blocked are P@$$w0rd or Passw0rd1 and all variations. <br/>  &bull; **Custom banned password lists** - Admins can also create custom banned password lists to support specific business security needs. The custom banned password list prohibits passwords such as the organization name or location. <br/>  &bull; **Protecting against password spray** -  Most password spray attacks submit a few of the known weakest passwords against each of the accounts in an enterprise.<br/>  &bull;  **Hybrid security** - For hybrid security, admins can integrate Azure AD Password Protection within an on-premises Active Directory environment.  |
| [Azure Multi-Factor Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks) | Multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides additional security for your identities by requiring two or more elements for full authentication. These elements fall into three categories: <br/>   &bull; Something you know <br/>  &bull; Something you possess<br/>  &bull; Something you are <br/>|
| [Windows Hello for Business](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-overview) | Windows Hello, an authentication feature built into Windows 10, replaces passwords with strong two-factor authentication on PCs and mobile devices. This authentication consists of a new type of user credential that's ***tied to a device and uses a biometric or PIN***. <br/><br/> Windows Hello lets users authenticate to: <br/> &bull;  A Microsoft account. <br/>  &bull;   An Active Directory account. <br/>  &bull;   An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account. <br/> &bull; Identity Provider Services or Relying Party Services that support Fast ID Online (FIDO) v2.0 authentication (in preview) <br/> <br/> There are two configurations for Windows Hello: Windows Hello convenience PIN and Windows Hello for Business. <br/> <br/> &bull; Windows Hello convenience PIN is configured by a user on their personal device. Windows Hello convenience PIN is not backed by asymmetric (public or private key) or certificate-based authentication. <br/> &bull; Windows Hello for Business is configured by Group Policy or mobile device management (MDM) policy, such as Microsoft Intune. In addition, the PIN or biometric used with Windows Hello for Business is backed by key-based or certificate-based authentication, making it more secure than Windows Hello convenience PIN.|

### Describe access management capabilities of Azure AD

| Term | Description |
|--|--|
| [Conditional Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-access-management-capabilities/2-describe-conditional-access-its-benefits) | Conditional Access is a feature of Azure AD that provides an extra layer of security before allowing authenticated users to access data or other assets. Conditional Access is implemented through policies that are created and managed in Azure AD. A Conditional Access policy analyses signals including user, location, device, application, and risk to automate decisions for authorizing access to resources (apps and data). [What is Conditional Access?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview)|
| [Uses and benefits of conditional access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/plan-conditional-access) | When the Conditional Access policy has been applied, an informed decision is reached on whether to grant access, block access, or require extra verification. The decision is referred to as the access controls portion of the Conditional Access policy and defines how a policy is enforced. Common decisions <br/> &bull;  Block access<br/>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &bull;  Most restrictive decision<br/>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &bull;   Grant access <br/>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;   Least restrictive decision, can still require one or more of the following options: <br/>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &bull;   Require multi-factor authentication <br/>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &bull;    Require device to be marked as compliant <br/>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;  Require Hybrid Azure AD joined device <br/>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         &bull; Require approved client app <br/>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;   Require app protection policy (preview)<br/><br/> Many organizations have common access concerns that Conditional Access policies can help with such as: <br/> &bull;  Requiring multi-factor authentication for users with administrative roles <br/>  &bull;  Requiring multi-factor authentication for Azure management tasks <br/>  &bull;  Blocking sign-ins for users attempting to use legacy authentication protocols <br/>  &bull;  Requiring trusted locations for Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication registration <br/>  &bull;  Blocking or granting access from specific locations <br/> &bull;  Blocking risky sign-in behaviors <br/>  &bull;  Requiring organization-managed devices for specific applications |
| Benefits of Azure AD roles | Azure AD roles control permissions to manage Azure AD resources. There are many built-in roles for different areas of responsibility. All built-in roles are preconfigured bundles of permissions designed for specific tasks. Azure AD built-in and custom roles are a form of RBAC in that Azure AD roles control access to Azure AD resources. It's best practice, and more secure, to grant users the least privilege to get their work done.|

### Describe the identity protection & governance capabilities of Azure AD

| Term | Description |
|--|--|
| [Identity governance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/governance/identity-governance-overview) | Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Identity Governance allows you to balance your organization's need for security and employee productivity with the right processes and visibility. It provides you with capabilities to ensure that the right people have the right access to the right resources. <br/> <br/> Identity Governance give organizations the ability to do the following tasks across employees, business partners and vendors, and across services and applications both on-premises and in clouds: <br/> &bull; Govern the identity lifecycle <br/> &bull; Govern access lifecycle <br/> &bull; Secure privileged access for administration <br/>  <br/> Specifically, it is intended to help organizations address these four key questions: <br/> &bull; Which users should have access to which resources?  <br/> &bull; What are those users doing with that access? <br/> &bull; Are there effective organizational controls for managing access? <br/> &bull; Can auditors verify that the controls are working? |
| [Entitlement management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-overview) | Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) entitlement management is an identity governance feature that enables organizations to manage identity and access lifecycle at scale, by automating access request workflows, access assignments, reviews, and expiration. Allows your organization to manage access to groups, applications, and SharePoint online sites for both useres internal and external or the org. This includes self service workflows, approval workflows and expiration policies. It does this in part by leveraging "access packages".  An **access package** is a bundle of all the resources with the access a user needs to work on a project or perform their task. |
| [Access reviews](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/governance/access-reviews-overview) | Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) access reviews enable organizations to efficiently manage group memberships, access to enterprise applications, and role assignments. **Primarily it provides**: <br/> &bull;  Enables organizations to recertify, attest and audi users' access to resources - Office groups, Azure AD groups, Azure AD integration apps, Azure AD roles and Azure RBAC roles <br/> &bull;  Approve or deny employees and guest users continued access <br/> &bull;  Select reviewers to be group owners, members themselves and individuals in the directory <br/> &bull;  Recommends decisions to reviewer based on user sign-in activity <br/> &bull;  Option to set up recurring reviews and apply the decisions automatically <br/><br/> **When should you use access reviews?** <br/> &bull;  Too many users in privileged roles <br/> &bull;  When automation is not possible <br/> &bull;  When a group is used for a new purpose <br/>  &bull;  Business critical data access <br/>  &bull;  To maintain a policy's exception list <br/> |
| [Capabilities of Privileged Identity Management (PIM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure) | Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a service in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that enables you to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in your organization. These resources include resources in Azure AD, Azure, and other Microsoft Online Services such as Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Intune. It does this through supporting the following: <br/> &bull; **Just-in-Time access** (expires after per-defined activation period is over) <br/> &bull; **Time-bound** assess (tied to start/end dates - Useful for guests/contractors) <br/> &bull; **Privileged Admin Workflow** (e.g. manager OK's access) <br/> &bull; **Enforcement of MFA** to activate role <br/> &bull; Text box for user **justification** on their need to access a resources, which assists with internal / external audits.

### [Describe ways Azure encrypts data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-basic-security-capabilities-azure/7-describe-ways-azure-encrypts-data)
### Encryption on Azure

Microsoft Azure provides many different ways to secure your data, each depending on the service or usage required.

-   **Azure Storage Service Encryption**  helps to protect data at rest by automatically encrypting before persisting it to Azure-managed disks, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Files, or Azure Queue Storage, and decrypts the data before retrieval.
-   **Azure Disk Encryption**  helps you encrypt Windows and Linux IaaS virtual machine disks. Azure Disk Encryption uses the industry-standard BitLocker feature of Windows and the dm-crypt feature of Linux to provide volume encryption for the OS and data disks.
-   **Transparent data encryption (TDE)**  helps protect Azure SQL Database and Azure Data Warehouse against the threat of malicious activity. It performs real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and transaction log files at rest without requiring changes to the application.

### What is Azure Key Vault?

Azure Key Vault is a centralized cloud service for storing your application secrets. Key Vault helps you control your applications' secrets by keeping them in a single, central location and by providing secure access, permissions control, and access logging capabilities. It's useful for different kinds of scenarios:

-   **Secrets management**. You can use Key Vault to store securely and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, Application Programming Interface (API) keys, and other secrets.
-   **Key management**. You can use Key Vault as a key management solution. Key Vault makes it easier to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.
-   **Certificate management**. Key Vault lets you provision, manage, and deploy your public and private Secure Sockets Layer/ Transport Layer Security (SSL/ TLS) certificates for Azure, and internally connected, resources more easily.
-   **Store secrets backed by hardware security modules (HSMs)**. The secrets and keys can be protected either by software or by FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated HSMs.

Actions can also be considered technical or nontechnical, which also affects how they impact the overall compliance score. <br/> <br/> Actions are also assigned a score value based on whether theyâ€™re categorized as mandatory, discretionary, preventative, detective, or corrective: <br/> &bull;  **Mandatory** â€“ these actions shouldnâ€™t be bypassed. For example, creating a policy to set requirements for password length or expiration. <br/> &bull; **Discretionary** â€“ these actions depend on the users understanding and adhering to a policy. For example, a policy where users are required to ensure their devices are locked before they leave them. <br/> <br/> *The following are subcategories of actions that can be classified as mandatory or discretionary:*<br/> &bull;  **Preventative** actions are designed to handle specific risks, like using encryption to protect data at rest if there were breaches or attacks. <br/> &bull;  **Detective** actions actively monitor systems to identify irregularities that could represent risks, or that can be used to detect breaches or intrusions. Examples of these types of actions are system access audits, or regulatory compliance audits. <br/>  &bull;  **Corrective** actions help admins to minimize the adverse effects of security incidents, by undertaking corrective measures to reduce their immediate effect or possibly even reverse damage.<br/> [Compliance score calculation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/compliance-score-calculation?view=o365-worldwide)|

### Describe information protection and governance capabilities of Microsoft 365

| Term | Description |
|--|--|
| [Data classification capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-information-protection-governance-capabilities-microsoft-365/3-describe-data-classification-capabilities-compliance-center) | **Sensitive information types** have set patterns that can be used to identify them (e.g. server name + airport code). Microsoft 365 includes many built-in sensitive information types based on patterns that are defined by a regular expression (regex) or a function. (e.g. credit card numbers, SSN, bank account numbers, etc.) <br/> <br/> **Trainable classifiers** use artificial intelligence and machine learning to intelligently classify your data. They're most useful classifying data unique to an organization like specific kinds of contracts, invoices, or customer records. This method of classification is more about training a classifier to identify an item based on what the item is, not by elements that are in the item (pattern matching). <br/><br/> **Two types of classifier are available:** <br/> <br/> &bull; **Pre-trained classifiers** - Microsoft has created and pretrained many classifiers that you can start using without training them. These classifiers will appear with the status of Ready to use. Microsoft 365 comes with five pretrained classifiers that detect and classify things like resumes, source code, harassment, profanity, and threat (relates to committing violence or doing physical harm). <br/>  <br/> &bull; **Custom trainable classifiers** - Microsoft supports the ability to create and train custom classifiers. They're most useful when classifying data unique to an organization, like specific kinds of contracts, invoices, or customer records.<br/> [Learn about data classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/data-classification-overview?view=o365-worldwide)|
| [Value of content and activity explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/data-classification-activity-explorer?view=o365-worldwide) |The **content explorer** is available as a tab in the data classification pane of compliance center. It enables administrators to gain visibility into the content that has been summarized in the overview pane. Access to content explorer is highly restricted because it makes it possible to read the contents of scanned files. There are two roles that grant access to content explorer: "Content explorer list viewer" and "Content explorer content viewer". <br/><br/> **Activity explorer** provides visibility into what content has been discovered and labeled, and where that content is. It makes it possible to monitor what's being done with labeled content across the organization. Admins gain visibility into document-level activities like label changes and label downgrades (such as when someone changes a label from confidential to public). <br/> <br/> You should use activity explorer to see a historical view of what is being done with content labels. It provides detailed information about sensitivity label activities, retention label activities, Azure Information Protection (AIP) protection activity, and data loss prevention (DLP) policy matches events, including endpoint data loss prevention. <br/> [Getting Started With Activity Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/data-classification-activity-explorer?view=o365-worldwide)|
| [Sensitivity labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-information-protection-governance-capabilities-microsoft-365/4-describe-sensitivity-labels-policies) | Sensitivity labels, available as part of information protection in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, enable the labeling and protection of content, without affecting productivity and collaboration. With sensitivity labels, organizations can decide on labels to apply to content such as emails and documents, much like different stamps are applied to physical documents and can be used to automate tasks such as encrypting e-mail based on the label. <br/> <br/> **Labels are:** <br/> &bull;    **Customizable**: Admins can create different categories specific to the organization, such as Personal, Public, Confidential, and Highly Confidential. <br/> &bull;  **Clear text**: Because each label is stored in clear text in the content's metadata, third-party apps and services can read it and then apply their own protective actions, if necessary. <br/> &bull;  **Persistent**. After you apply a sensitivity label to content, the label is stored in the metadata of that email or document. The label then moves with the content, including the protection settings, and this data becomes the basis for applying and enforcing policies. <br/> <br/> After sensitivity labels are created, they need to be published to make them available to people and services in the organization. Sensitivity labels are published to users or groups through **label policies**. Sensitivity labels will then appear in Office apps for those users and groups. |
| [Retention Polices and Retention Labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-information-protection-governance-capabilities-microsoft-365/6-describe-retention-polices-retention-labels) | Retention labels and policies help organizations to manage and govern information by ensuring content is kept only for a required time, and then permanently deleted. Applying retention labels and assigning retention policies helps organizations: <br/> &bull; Comply proactively with industry regulations and internal policies that require content to be kept for a minimum time. <br/> &bull;  Reduce risk when there's litigation or a security breach by permanently deleting old content that the organization is no longer required to keep. <br/> &bull; Ensure users work only with content that's current and relevant to them. **Retention policies** <br/> Retention policies are used to assign the same retention settings to content at a site level or mailbox level. <br/> &bull; A single policy can be applied to multiple locations, or to specific locations or users. <br/> &bull; Items inherit the retention settings from their container specified in the retention policy. If a policy is configured to keep content, and an item is then moved outside that container, a copy of the item is kept in the workload's secured location. However, the retention settings don't travel with the content in its new location. <br/>  <br/> **Retention labels** <br/> &bull; Retention labels are used to assign retention settings at an item level, such as a folder, document, or email. <br/> &bull; An email or document can have only a single retention label assigned to it at a time. <br/> &bull; Retention settings from retention labels travel with the content if itâ€™s moved to a different location within your Microsoft 365 tenant. <br/> &bull; Admins can enable users in the organization to apply a retention label manually. <br/> &bull; A retention label can be applied automatically if it matches defined conditions. <br/> &bull; A default label can be applied for SharePoint documents. <br/> &bull; Retention labels support disposition review to review the content before it's permanently deleted. <br/>[Learn about retention policies and retention labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/retention?view=o365-worldwide) |
| [Records Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-information-protection-governance-capabilities-microsoft-365/7-describe-records-management) | Organizations of all types require a management solution to manage regulatory, legal, and business-critical records across their corporate data. Records management in Microsoft 365 helps an organization look after their legal obligations. It also helps to demonstrate compliance with regulations, and increases efficiency with regular disposition of items that are no longer required to be kept, no longer of value, or no longer required for business purposes. It provides the following capabilities: <br/>  <br/> Labeling content as a record. <br/> &bull; Migrating and managing retention plans with file plan manager. <br/> &bull; Establishing retention and deletion policies within the record label. <br/> &bull; Triggering event-based retention. <br/> &bull; Reviewing and validating disposition. <br/> &bull; Proof of records deletion. <br/> &bull; Exporting information about disposed items.  <br/> &bull; Setting specific permissions for record manager functions in the organization. <br/>  <br/> **When content is labeled as a record, the following happens:**  <br/> &bull; Restrictions are put in place to block certain activities. <br/> &bull; Activities are logged. <br/> &bull; Proof of disposition is kept at the end of the retention period. <br/>  <br/> [Learn about records management in Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/records-management?view=o365-worldwide) |
| [Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/describe-information-protection-governance-capabilities-microsoft-365/5-describe-data-loss-prevention) | Data loss prevention (DLP) is a way to protect sensitive information and prevent its inadvertent disclosure. **DLP policies** protect content through the enforcement of rules that consist of: <br/> &bull; Conditions that the content must match before the rule is enforced. <br/> &bull; Actions that the admin wants the rule to take automatically when content that matches the conditions has been found. <br/> &bull; Locations where the policy will be applied, such as Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, and more.<br/> <br/>[Learn about data loss prevention](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/dlp-learn-about-dlp?view=o365-worldwide) |

| [Information barriers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/m365-compliance-insider-plan-information-barriers/) | Information barriers enable administrators to define policies to allow or prevent communications between groups of users in Microsoft Teams chats and channels. When information barrier policies are in place, people who should not communicate with other specific users won't be able to find, select, chat, or call those users. With information barriers, checks are in place to prevent unauthorized communication. <br/> [Learn about information barriers in Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/information-barriers?view=o365-worldwide) |
| [Privileged access management (PAM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/m365-compliance-insider-implement-privileged-access-management/) | Privileged access management allows granular access control over privileged admin tasks in Office 365. Privileged access management requires users to request just-in-time access to complete elevated and privileged tasks through a highly scoped and time-bound approval workflow. This configuration gives users just-enough-access to perform the task at hand without risking exposure of sensitive data or critical configuration settings. <br/>[Learn about privileged access management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/privileged-access-management-overview?view=o365-worldwide) <br/><br/> Note: Privileged access management is defined and scoped at the task level, while Azure AD Privileged Identity Management applies protection at the role level with the ability to execute multiple tasks. Azure AD Privileged Identity Management primarily allows managing accesses for AD roles and role groups, while privileged access management in Microsoft 365 applies only at the task level.|
